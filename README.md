# wingPartWithRibDeisgn
created a winged part based off of a cad drawing found online

This might be the part I am most proud of currently. It is a very humble part, nothing of grandeur, but it was something I felt like I built from the ground up. The cad drawing I used as reference
felt the most bare compared to other ones I've used before, making it a lot more difficult (at least for me) to create the initial sketches and build out from there. I am very proud of myself, even 
in this beginner stage, to be able to utilize different techniques in creating the cad part. While I must confess it took me around 2 hours to construct the part, I am glad to say that I have 
successfully 3d modelled the part from 2d.

The image I used as reference came from TheCADWhisperer on an autodesk forum post on the topic of "Challenge Me With Cad Work" (https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-design-validate-document/challenge-me-with-cad-work/td-p/9203070)
